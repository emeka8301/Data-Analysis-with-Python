# Data-Analysis-with-Python 
These projects are to show my comfortability with python data analysis and science library packages. I carried out projects that worked with data from a collection of movies, baby names from 1880-2021 and 2012 US presidential election. The aim of these projects are to show a range of data analysis techniques and visualisation.
